Sometimes the win32com has a hiccup that results in something like this

AttributeError: module 'win32com.gen_py.AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAAxAxAxA' has no attribute 'CLSIDToClassMap'

when calling the EnsureDispatch() method.

This script cleans the win32com cache up. Afterwards, the other scripts should work as usual
